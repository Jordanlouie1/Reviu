## Anonymous Peer Review Platform

This is a modern, responsive web application for scholars to submit and review papers annoymously. Qualified annoynomous reviewers are verified using zero knowledge proofs based off previous work

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Peer review is the backbone of academic and technical innovation â€” yet the current system is outdated, opaque, and exclusionary.
  Reviews often take months, and are locked behind journal walls.
  Independent researchers and interdisciplinary thinkers are ignored due to institutional gatekeeping.
  Reviewers do unpaid work and get no lasting reputation or proof of their contributions.
  Thereâ€™s little to no transparency in who reviews what, and no way to match papers to the right experts at scale.
